# Zoo-Data-Machine-Learning-Project
This project is an Animal Classification System that reads animal data from a file, analyzes features, and performs various operations like generating statistics, calculating distances (Euclidean, Hamming, Jaccard), and classifying new samples using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
